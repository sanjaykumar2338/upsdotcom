UPS BULK IMAGE DOWNLOADER - USER MANUAL (ORDER #2)
==================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This software is the Phase 2 upgrade of the UPS Scraper. It includes a specific 
feature to handle bulk image downloading. You now have a toggle switch (Checkbox) 
to control whether you want to save the map files or just the data.

NEW FEATURE: IMAGE TOGGLE
-------------------------
On the main screen, you will see a new checkbox labeled:
[ ] Download Map Images

* UNCHECKED (Default): 
  The tool runs at maximum speed and saves only the CSV Data (Links/Dates).
  
* CHECKED: 
  The tool visits every link and downloads the high-quality PNG map file 
  to your local computer.

HOW TO RUN
----------
1. Launch the Application ('ups_images.py' or 'UPS_Scraper.exe').

2. Click "Browse" next to Input CSV and select your file containing ZIP codes.

3. Click "Browse" next to Output CSV to choose where to save the report.

4. **CRITICAL STEP:** Check the box labeled "Download Map Images".
   (This tells the bot you want to save the actual image files).

5. Click "START SCRAPER".
   - A browser window will open and minimize.
   - The status bar will show progress.

WHERE ARE MY IMAGES?
--------------------
Once the job is finished, look inside the folder where this application is located.

1. You will see a new folder named "images".
2. Open it to find all your map files.
3. Each file is named after its ZIP code (e.g., '90210.png') for easy matching.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
* "Folder is empty":
  Make sure you ticked the "Download Map Images" checkbox before clicking Start.

* "Process is slower":
  Downloading images takes more time and internet bandwidth than just scraping text. 
  Please allow the tool extra time to complete the batch.

* "Windows Defender / Antivirus":
  If the application is blocked, it is likely because it automates the 
  Chrome browser. Please "Allow" the application to run.
